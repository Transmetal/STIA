# STIA

# About

From Now no need to remember all the commands to achieve your hacking goals. No need to remember all the flags and combinations for successful brute-forcing or password cracking tasks. All that you have to do is to choose the tool from the STIA menu give the script the IP of the target the wordlist you want to use and it will do the hard part. STIA script was just a simple coding exercise but now it's a whole project that I want to develop in order to create something that can turn any Linux distro into a hacking beast. Now STIA script runs on Linux and windows. For the best compatibility you should run it on Kali Linux or parrot OS soon you will no longer need to use these distros.
